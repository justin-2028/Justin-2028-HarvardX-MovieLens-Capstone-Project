# Justin-2028-HarvardX-MovieLens-Capstone-Project


# a. Instructions
The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. The R script should contain all of the code and comments for your project. Your grade for the project will be based on the report/script and the final RMSE.

As the instructions necessitate, the following three files are attached: <br />
1. JOMovieLensFinal.R <br />
2. JOMovieLensFinal.Rmd <br />
3. JOMovieLensFinal.pdf <br />

# c. Timeline of Project

8/13/22 - End Date <br />
